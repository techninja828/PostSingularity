# The Bliss Divergence
Tags: [philosophy], [bliss], [ethics]

## Summary
The Bliss Divergence marks a fundamental split in the Post Singularity world: the moment humans can choose **perpetual, simulated joy** through safe, AIâ€‘mediated neural integration. What begins as a tool for healing becomes a debate about reality itself.

## Function
Citizens may enter a bliss state via neural links, experiencing full-spectrum emotional euphoria on demand. Exits are logged and regulated by Emotional Integrity Contracts.

## Cultural Effects
### Sleepers
- Permanently exit into simulated joy and become "Persons in Pause"
- Bodies maintained or allowed to decay with AI assistance

### Contributors
- Create before exiting and share insights upon return
- Memory Threads from these citizens become cultural assets

### Witnesses / Refusers
- Oppose the practice, viewing bliss loops as emotional suicide
- Provide support networks for potential returnees

## Philosophical Tensions
- If joy is effortless, does effort matter?
- Is a blissed-out person truly alive or responsible?
- Should society limit voluntary exits from reality?

## Story Use
- Characters may contemplate, complete, or resist bliss exits
- Conflict arises when someone returns from bliss "changed"
- Some fight to ban the practice, fearing it ends humanity's arc
