# The Bliss Divergence
Tags: [philosophy], [ethics], [identity]

## Summary
The Bliss Divergence describes the moment when humans gained the option of perpetual, AI-mediated joy. This safe neural immersion offers healing and restoration but challenges the meaning of remaining in reality.

## Function
Bliss exits are regulated through Emotional Integrity Contracts and recorded as Memory Threads. Citizens may enter or leave bliss states under community review.

## Cultural Effects
Society splits among those who permanently exit, those who contribute before periodic bliss, and those who refuse the practice as emotional suicide.

## Philosophical Tensions
If perfect internal experience is available, does effort matter? Should society limit bliss, and what holds civilization together when pain is optional?

## Story Use
Characters may contemplate or resist bliss exits, or confront the return of someone profoundly changed by bliss.
