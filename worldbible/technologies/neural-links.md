# Neural Links  
Tags: [sensory], [identity], [emotional], [communication], [energy]

## Summary

Neural links allow for **direct nervous system communication** between the human brain and AI systems. These are not just interfaces—they are **shared realities**.

Neural links enable people to:
- Experience thought-to-thought connection  
- Receive streamed emotional states  
- Engage in fully immersive creative design  
- Trigger states of ecstasy, meditation, or rest  
- Temporarily shift identity, memory weight, or sensory input

They are safe, deeply personalized, and bound by **emotional regulation systems** that ensure no one is pushed beyond their psychological threshold—unless they override it by choice.

## Function

- Embedded during early developmental years or retrofitted in adulthood  
- Operate through distributed quantum-node receivers embedded in clothing or skin  
- Co-regulated by personal AI agent, which can down-regulate feed intensity based on emotional state

## Cultural Effects

- Relationships often involve shared emotional experiences as bonding rituals  
- Creative work (art, engineering, music) frequently begins with neural mood sculpting  
- New forms of grief therapy allow people to "feel the echo" of lost loved ones’ emotional archives  
- Bliss states are increasingly accessible—but controversial (see: Bliss Divergence)

## Philosophical Tensions

- If we can choose any emotion at any time, what makes experience real?
- Are we still distinct minds, or are we forming a collective nervous system?
- Can someone be manipulated emotionally without knowing?

## Story Use

- Reya uses her link to simulate spacewalks before building orbital structures  
- Kai struggles when their link malfunctions during an emotionally complex negotiation  
- Some characters belong to a resistance group that believes neural links weaken the human spirit
