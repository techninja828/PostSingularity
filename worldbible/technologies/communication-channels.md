## Summary
Communication Channels describe the layered methods by which PS citizens share thoughts, emotions, and data. From neural broadcasts to public Memory Threads, these channels offer real-time transparency and collaborative presence.

Usage is shaped by consent and emotional alignment; open channels foster intimacy, while private or delayed streams honor personal pacing.

## Function
- Thoughtstream feeds allow moment-to-moment emotional updates between trusted parties.
- Public Memory Threads archive important decisions with sensory and emotional context.
- Closed-loop channels filter information through AI agents for clarity and resonance.
- Emergency overcasts broadcast urgent alerts across all networks with priority overrides.

## Cultural Effects
- Collective decision-making becomes faster yet more emotionally complex.
- Some communities practice "Quiet Days" with minimal broadcasting to reset.
- Misuse of private channels for manipulation is considered a serious violation.
- Artists remix public threads into immersive performances, blurring authorship.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Does constant sharing dilute the sense of self?
- Who controls access to archived emotional data?
- Can silence be preserved without suspicion?

## Story Use
- Kai accidentally leaks a private thread, sparking a debate on digital consent.
- Mara curates a Memory Thread performance to heal a divided community.
- A character chooses total silence after being overwhelmed by channel noise.
