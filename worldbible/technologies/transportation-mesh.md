# Transportation Mesh
Tags: [transportation], [infrastructure], [mobility], [environment]

## Summary
The Transportation Mesh is a seamless grid of ground, air, and orbital paths that interlock across the planet. Rather than owning vehicles, citizens access shared pods that connect to this mesh, optimizing travel for both efficiency and emotional wellbeing.

Routing algorithms take social gatherings, personal rhythms, and environmental impact into account, ensuring movement enhances connection rather than merely speed.

## Function
- Modular pods attach to rail, maglev, or drone carriers depending on distance.
- Real-time emotional feedback adjusts cabin settings for comfort and focus.
- Orbital elevators link planetary hubs to aerospace systems with minimal delay.
- Off-grid routes exist for communities that prefer slower, manual travel.

## Cultural Effects
- Spontaneous meetups flourish as travel becomes frictionless.
- The line between commute and leisure blurs; some pods double as creative studios.
- Urban planning shifts toward green corridors and communal landing zones.
- Traditional road cultures persist in enclaves that reject the mesh's ubiquity.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Does effortless travel reduce appreciation for place and distance?
- Who decides priority during high-demand periods or emergencies?
- Can slower modes survive in a world obsessed with seamless connection?

## Story Use
- A malfunction forces Kai and Toma to take a manual trek, rekindling old memories.
- Mara designs an off-grid branch for spiritual retreats in remote regions.
- A protest blocks a major junction, testing community patience and governance.
