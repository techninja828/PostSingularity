## Summary
Aerospace Systems extend the PS ethos beyond Earth, linking orbital habitats, research stations, and off-world settlements. Advances in propulsion and life support allow for sustainable presence in space without severing ties to planetary culture.

Stations are designed as emotional sanctuaries as much as engineering feats, fostering reflection on humanity's place in the cosmos.

## Function
- Modular habitat rings support long-term life with recycled air and water loops.
- Ion and solar-sail craft handle most propulsion, coordinated by AI guidance nets.
- Orbital platforms serve as gateways for asteroid mining and deep-space telescopes.
- Communication relays maintain constant thoughtstream links with planetary communities.

## Cultural Effects
- Spacefaring becomes a rite of passage for many engineers and philosophers.
- Art installations float in orbit, visible from the ground during celebration cycles.
- Ethical debates arise over terraforming versus preserving extraterrestrial landscapes.
- Some settlers choose permanent orbital life, forming tight-knit micro-societies.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Are humans meant to expand endlessly, or to steward existing worlds first?
- Does life in space dilute cultural roots, or offer fresh perspectives on identity?
- Should off-world discoveries be shared freely or guarded as strategic resources?

## Story Use
- Reya oversees a habitat ring where old Earth customs blend with experimental governance.
- A mysterious signal from beyond the solar system tests the limits of communication relays.
- Mara argues against mining a comet that holds spiritual significance for her community.
