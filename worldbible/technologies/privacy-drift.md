# Privacy Drift  
Tags: [privacy], [identity], [governance], [emotional], [communication]

## Summary

After Day 0 PS, privacy didn't collapse—it **became obsolete**.

With neural links, AI agents, emotional feedback, and public Memory Threads, the very concept of "keeping something hidden" eroded. Instead of defending boundaries, PS society learned to **navigate exposure** with care, context, and consent.

## Function

- **Gradient Privacy Fields**: Users control layers of emotional and informational access with nuance—like tuning an aperture, not flipping a switch.
- **Public Memory Threads**: Significant actions and contributions are archived and optionally viewable, often with emotional metadata.
- **Contextual Consent Protocols**: When someone engages with your story, feedback, or presence, AI agents ensure *why*, *how much*, and *what tone* is involved.

## Cultural Effects

- Shame no longer revolves around *what is seen*, but *what is distorted*
- Children learn emotional boundary-setting as a primary skill
- Gossip evolves into “echo curation”—narrative remixing with permission layers
- An emerging subculture embraces radical openness—streaming thoughts, memories, dreams in real time

## Philosophical Tensions

- If everyone sees you, are you still a self?
- Can truth exist when everything is emotionally colored?
- Is it ethical to preserve privacy when others may benefit from your emotional data?

## Story Use

- Toma’s enclave reinvents analog privacy—paper letters, wordless communication, masked emotions  
- A citizen’s old memory thread resurfaces, triggering shame and social distortion  
- Reya must choose whether to share a memory that could unify a project—or destabilize a relationship
