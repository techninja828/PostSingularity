## Summary
Drone Logistics networks coordinate the movement of materials and people across the globe. Swarms of aerial and ground drones operate in harmony with human needs, guided by AI agents that monitor emotional and ecological impact.

These fleets replaced most manual shipping, enabling rapid response to crises and equitable distribution of rare resources.

## Function
- Autonomous drones form mesh networks for real-time routing adjustments.
- Energy-efficient flight patterns draw power from wireless charging grids.
- Human overseers intervene through emotional feedback cues when needed.
- Specialized cargo pods maintain temperature and security for delicate goods.

## Cultural Effects
- Remote communities feel less isolated as delivery becomes near-instant.
- Noise and visual pollution lead to designated drone corridors above cities.
- Piloting competitions arise as hobbyists sync with drone swarms for sport.
- Some groups reject drones, preferring traditional courier rituals.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Does reliance on drones weaken communal interdependence?
- Who bears responsibility when an automated delivery causes harm?
- Are human couriers obsolete or part of emotional heritage?

## Story Use
- Kai hijacks a drone swarm to divert emergency supplies during a storm.
- A festival honors the first manual courier who guided early drone AI.
- Toma's enclave disrupts drone paths to enforce privacy boundaries.
