# Replication Systems
Tags: [infrastructure], [scarcity], [energy], [emotional]

## Summary
Replication Systems provide on-demand creation of most physical goods. Nano-scale printers and biofab units convert raw matter or ambient energy into finished products. They emerged after Day 0 PS as societies focused on eliminating survival anxiety.

These systems are heavily regulated by community emotional agreements. Access is universal but choices about what to replicate reflect local values and ecological harmony.

## Function
- Matter-to-matter printers reconfigure harvested minerals and reclaimed waste.
- Biofabricators grow organic materials such as food and textiles from cell stocks.
- Energy taps convert ambient solar and kinetic energy into raw fabrication power.
- AI agents oversee patterns to avoid dangerous or emotionally harmful outputs.

## Cultural Effects
- Scarcity-driven economies fade, shifting focus to craft and emotional intent.
- Communities debate what should remain handmade as a sign of care.
- Personal replicators become symbols of trustâ€”misuse is a major breach.
- Rituals form around giving away first prints to friends or collaborators.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Does endless availability erode gratitude or meaning?
- Who decides which replication patterns are safe or sacred?
- Can creativity thrive when material limits vanish?

## Story Use
- Reya gifts a hand-assembled tool instead of a replicated version to show respect.
- A rogue replication file threatens to flood the market with dangerous nanotech.
- Community councils pause replicator access during a cultural mourning period.
