# PS Technology Index

Technology in the Post Singularity world is not a tool—it’s an **extension of consciousness**.

After Day 0 PS, innovation accelerated beyond human comprehension. But instead of unchecked expansion, a new ethic emerged:  
> **“Only the emotionally aligned shall persist.”**

This index organizes key technologies in the PS world—not by hardware, but by the human challenges they shape: identity, trust, presence, and transformation.
