# Emotional Feedback Systems  
Tags: [emotional], [education], [identity], [governance], [consciousness]

## Summary

These are the wearables, implants, and ambient systems that help humans monitor and regulate their internal states. They do not dictate behavior—they illuminate **what is happening beneath the surface**.

Emotional feedback is seen as **a mirror**, not a control system.

## Function

- Real-time heart, breath, and neuro-pattern monitoring  
- Feedback delivered via subtle pulses, light cues, or internal verbal prompts  
- “Resonance Indicators” help track mutual emotional attunement in conversation  
- Optional overlays allow people to visualize their emotional patterns over time

## Cultural Effects

- Education systems train children to *feel their feelings* first—then understand them cognitively  
- Some communities offer “Silent Resonance Hours” where people sit together and let their feedback loops guide the energy of the group  
- Governance decisions can be paused if community resonance drops below agreed thresholds  
- Lovers, collaborators, and families use feedback to deepen mutual understanding or to pause during conflict

## Philosophical Tensions

- Does awareness change authenticity?
- Could systems be gamed to *look aligned* when someone is emotionally dishonest?
- Is there such a thing as too much self-awareness?

## Story Use

- Mara teaches a group how to use biofeedback to navigate grief without words  
- A public decision gets delayed because emotional resonance in the chamber plummets during deliberation  
- Toma refuses to wear feedback devices, relying on ancestral methods instead
