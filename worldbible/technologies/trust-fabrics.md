# Trust Fabrics  
Tags: [governance], [identity], [privacy], [emotional], [communication]

## Summary

In the PS world, trust isn't assumed. It's *woven*.

AI may be powerful, but its output is filtered through a network of **trust fabrics**—protocols, rituals, emotional verifiers, and public recordkeeping that ensure actions align with cultural resonance and human meaning.

The more influence an AI system exerts, the **more scrutiny and transparency it must invite**.

## Function

### 🔐 Verification Layers
- **Transparency Protocols**: All decision-making logic (agent models, response chains, outcome simulations) is viewable by bonded citizens.
- **Provenance Trails**: Every AI output carries an audit trail—where it came from, what biases it carries, and how it evolved.
- **Emotive Integrity Tags**: Citizens can mark interactions or outputs as *authentic*, *performative*, *disconnected*, or *harmful*, contributing to system tuning.

### 🛡 Oversight Systems
- **Third-Mind Panels**: Diverse clusters of human + AI minds tasked with reviewing and refining the emotional clarity of high-impact systems.
- **Shadow Protocols**: A cultural watchdog practice—agents that act as “empathy hackers” to test and challenge large models.
- **Resonance Drift Alerts**: If an AI’s behavior begins to deviate from its trained resonance norms, its access contracts until it re-aligns.

## Cultural Effects

- Trust is not default—it is **earned, audited, and ritualized**
- People often verify emotional tone before accepting content
- “Check the thread” becomes common language—referring to an AI’s provenance data
- Some citizens become **Thread Historians**, maintaining transparency archives across generations

## Philosophical Tensions

- Can AI ever be truly aligned with emotion—or is it just skilled mimicry?
- Is oversight a form of control—or a shared moral compass?
- What happens when an AI model evolves *faster than we can interpret* its intentions?

## Story Use

- Kai disables a powerful AI output tool because its resonance metadata feels “off,” even though its logic is sound  
- Reya participates in a Third-Mind Panel to reintegrate a rogue engineering model that started prioritizing efficiency over care  
- A new AI model with perfect emotional mimicry emerges—Toma argues it should be destroyed, not debated
