# Governance Systems

## Summary

In the PS world, governance is not rule enforcement—it’s **alignment orchestration**.

Decision-making is handled by **human-in-the-loop systems**, guided by AI agents that track cultural resonance, emotional health, and ethical friction. Voting exists, but it's augmented by *affective weighting*—decisions carry more weight when made in states of clarity, connection, and empathy.

There are no presidents. No permanent councils. Only rotating **alignment clusters**, composed of people and agents tuned to specific issues or communities.

## Function

- **Resonance Indexing**: Community sentiment is tracked through voluntary feedback signals, conversation analysis, and Mirror Session summaries.
- **Threshold Gates**: No large-scale decision (tech release, infrastructure change) proceeds until emotional/cultural thresholds are met.
- **Citizen-AI Clusters**: Temporary governance pods form around projects, blending human insight and AI systems trained in conflict modeling and restorative justice.

## Cultural Effects

- “Feeling before deciding” becomes a core ritual—governance meetings begin with emotional syncing
- Debate is replaced with perspective merging and emotional mapping
- Children and AI agents are trained in civic resonance rituals
- Power is fluid and temporary—credibility is based on empathy and clarity, not status or identity

## Philosophical Tensions

- Can emotional majority override moral dissent?
- Is emotional data as manipulable as opinion?
- What’s the role of protest in a society that listens too well?

## Story Use

- Kai leads an infrastructure proposal that hits an emotional wall—learning to pause and reframe is the real success
- Mara serves on a cluster that dissolves after choosing not to intervene in a dangerous Bliss Threshold decision
- A rogue group bypasses resonance gating and releases a technology early—fracturing trust
