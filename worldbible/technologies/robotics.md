## Summary
Adaptive robots sense emotional and ecological context, reshaping their bodies and roles on the fly. They coordinate in swarms similar to [Drone Logistics](./drone-logistics.md) fleets and submit decisions through [Trust Fabrics](./trust-fabrics.md) so human intention stays central.

## Function
- Modular joints and soft interfaces let robots reconfigure for new tasks.
- Swarm meshes share sensor data for obstacle avoidance and resource allocation.
- Emotional telemetry flags misalignment and defers to human collaborators or local AIs.

## Cultural Effects
- Neighborhoods treat local robot collectives as communal tools rather than property.
- Craft guilds emerge to design custom skins and behaviors.
- Some communities restrict swarm presence during ceremonies to preserve intimacy.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Do adaptive robots erode the line between artifact and citizen?
- Who is accountable when a swarm consensus harms someone?

## Story Use
- [Arin](../../characters/arin.md) trains a crew of adaptive builders to repair storm damage while debating their autonomy.
- A rogue swarm breaks formation, forcing neighbors to rely on [Trust Fabrics](./trust-fabrics.md) for mediation.
- Robots partner with drone fleets to open pop-up corridors for emergency [Drone Logistics](./drone-logistics.md).
