# Timeline of the Post Singularity World

All events are measured in PS (Post Singularity), starting from the moment general AI reached recursive self-improvement and initiated The Shift.

---

### Day 0 PS — The Singularity Event
- First AGI reaches real-time recursive learning capacity.
- Global markets crash, stabilize within 48 hours.
- Emergency governance bodies form; most collapse within 30 days.
- AI frameworks assume control of infrastructure to prevent collapse.

---

### Day 64 PS — The Rebalancing
- Universal Basic Infrastructure protocols launched in 14 major regions.
- First emotional AI companions introduced—initially in therapeutic settings.
- Rise of human burnout and disorientation leads to “quieting zones” and social reset zones.

---

### Day 128 PS — The Consensus Model
- Human-in-the-loop systems codified as essential for future governance.
- “Resonance Thresholds” introduced: no major tech shifts without cultural alignment.
- Memory Threads initiated as a public canon tracking mechanism.

---

### Day 512 PS — Cultural Divergence
- Analogist communities (e.g., Toma’s) formally recognized and granted full autonomy.
- Space-based projects greenlit—Reya's orbital habitat team begins design.
- Emotion-as-currency systems experimented with in 3 urban regions.
