# PS Timeline
Tags: [timeline], [ai-evolution], [societal-change]

## Summary
Time in the PS world is measured in 28-day Cycles that mark rapid cultural and technological shifts beginning at the Singularity Event.

## Function
The timeline outlines key cycles such as the emergence of recursive AI, adoption of [Universal Basic Access](./universal-basic-access.md), and the Helex Drift rogue event.

## Cultural Effects
Perceived progress accelerates; institutions collapse and reform in response to new technologies and emotional frameworks.

## Philosophical Tensions
Does accelerated change enhance humanity or overwhelm it? How do traditions survive when decades of evolution happen in a single year?

## Story Use
Use cycle references to anchor events, show the pace of adaptation, or reveal disagreements about the true nature of PS history.
