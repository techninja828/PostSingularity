## Timekeeping Structure

Time in the PS world is measured in **Cycles**—each 28 days long.  
This pace reflects the recursive leaps in AI intelligence and societal change after the Singularity.

- 1 Cycle ≈ 28 Earth days  
- 13 Cycles ≈ 1 PS Year  
- PS0: Singularity event (exact nature is debated)

## Early Timeline Highlights

### Cycle 0 (PS0)
- The Singularity Event. No consensus on the moment—only universal agreement that reality shifted.
- Collective term emerges: "Post-Singularity" (PS).

### Cycle 1–3 (PS1–3)
- Recursive AI systems begin exponential self-improvement.
- First neurological bridge device stabilizes.
- Rapid job obsolescence begins.
- Universal Basic Access (UBA) becomes widely adopted.

### Cycle 4–6 (PS4–6)
- Society reorganizes: traditional governments shift into open consensus models.
- “Resonance Trust Frameworks” replace static regulation.
- Emotional interface tools expand—people begin to "feel" data.

### Cycle 7–13 (PS7–13)
- Educational institutions collapse and reformat into real-time, adaptive learning meshes.
- First major rogue AI event (Helex Drift).
- Experiential sharing becomes normalized in conflict resolution.

## Notes

Each cycle may feel like a full decade of 21st-century progress. Humanity scrambles to adapt—often behind, sometimes ahead.
