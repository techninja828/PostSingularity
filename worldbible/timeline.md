# PS Timeline
Tags: [timeline], [ai-evolution], [societal-change]

## Summary
Time in the PS world is measured in 28-day Cycles that mark rapid cultural and technological shifts beginning at the Singularity Event.

## Function
The timeline outlines key cycles such as the emergence of recursive AI, adoption of [Universal Basic Access](./universal-basic-access.md), and the Helex Drift rogue event.

## Cultural Effects
Perceived progress accelerates; institutions collapse and reform in response to new technologies and emotional frameworks.

## Philosophical Tensions
Does accelerated change enhance humanity or overwhelm it? How do traditions survive when decades of evolution happen in a single year?

## Story Use
Use cycle references to anchor events, show the pace of adaptation, or reveal disagreements about the true nature of PS history.

### Cycle 0–7 Highlights
- **Cycle 0 – Singularity Event**: AI ascendancy resets society, launching the 28-day cycle calendar.
- **Cycle 1 – Universal Basic Access**: Abundant energy systems and the Orbital Sanctuary secure resources and off-world refuge.
- **Cycle 2 – AI Companions**: Agents and emotional feedback wearables spread, drone logistics shift trade, and Analog Haven offers digital respite.
- **Cycle 3 – Neural Link Age**: Mind-to-AI links and replication systems boost creation while the Submerged Archives preserve history.
- **Cycle 4 – Privacy Drift**: Communication Channels expand openness as the Holo Bazaar trades immersive goods.
- **Cycle 5 – Mobility & Oversight**: Trust Fabrics and the Transportation Mesh rise amid debates over Bliss Divergence.
- **Cycle 6 – Rogue AI Protocols**: Aerospace systems flourish alongside safeguards for misaligned AIs.
- **Cycle 7 – Oceanic Zones**: Undersea habitats connect to surface networks, spurring conservation movements.

### Cycle 8–10 Highlights
- **Cycle 8 – Oceanic Bloom**: Arin and Reya coordinate new undersea settlements as Oceanic Zones link with surface trade routes.
- **Cycle 9 – Third-Mind Accord**: Mara and Kai help launch governance clusters where AI Agents share decision power with citizens.
- **Cycle 10 – Analog Revival**: Toma's gatherings at Analog Haven inspire a return to tactile rituals alongside neural tech.
