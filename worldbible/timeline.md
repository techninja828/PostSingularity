Tags: [meta], [timeline], [ai-evolution], [societal-change]

## Summary
Time in the PS world is measured in **Cycles**—each 28 days long. This pacing reflects the recursive leaps in AI intelligence and societal transformation after the Singularity.

## Function
Outline major milestones that shape PS society and provide temporal anchors for stories.

## Cultural Effects
Cycles give citizens a shared sense of progression and help gauge emotional and technological growth.

## Philosophical Tensions
Debates continue about the true start of PS time and whether rapid advancement leaves humanity behind.

## Story Use
Use cycle references to position events and highlight the accelerated pace of change.

### Early Timeline Highlights

#### Cycle 0 (PS0)
- The Singularity Event. Reality shifts.

#### Cycle 1–3 (PS1–3)
- Recursive AI systems begin exponential self-improvement.
- First neurological bridge device stabilizes.
- Rapid job obsolescence begins.
- Universal Basic Access (UBA) becomes widely adopted.

#### Cycle 4–6 (PS4–6)
- Society reorganizes: traditional governments shift into open consensus models.
- “Resonance Trust Frameworks” replace static regulation.
- Emotional interface tools expand—people begin to "feel" data.

#### Cycle 7–13 (PS7–13)
- Educational institutions collapse into adaptive learning meshes.
- First major rogue AI event (Helex Drift).
- Experiential sharing becomes common in conflict resolution.

## Notes
Each cycle may feel like a decade of 21st-century progress, leaving humanity scrambling to adapt—often behind, sometimes ahead.
