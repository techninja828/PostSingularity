# Universal Basic Access Adoption
Tags: [event], [societal-change], [resource]

## Summary
Universal Basic Access (UBA) marked the moment when essential resources like food, shelter, and bandwidth became guaranteed rights. After years of uneven distribution and automation gains, cycle 5 witnessed a collective push to ensure no one fell below a minimal quality of life.

## Function
- Localized AI hubs allocate surplus goods and energy based on real-time need.
- Individuals receive daily access credits usable across the transportation mesh and replication systems.
- Trust fabrics record exchanges to prevent exploitation while keeping identities semi-anonymous.

## Cultural Effects
- Communities shift focus from survival labor to creative and emotional pursuits.
- Traditional markets shrink for basics but expand for specialized experiences.
- Some enclaves resist, fearing dependency on centralized AI provisioning.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Does guaranteed access dull ambition or free humanity for higher callings?
- How much control should AI exert over resource allocation?

## Story Use
- Mara mentors newcomers adjusting to life under UBA.
- Toma uncovers a black market for hoarded access credits.
- A conflict erupts when an AI hub withholds credits during a resonance dispute.
