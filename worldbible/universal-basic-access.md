# Universal Basic Access
Tags: [infrastructure], [governance], [economy]

## Summary
Universal Basic Access (UBA) guarantees every citizen baseline housing, energy, communication, and health services. It arose when post-scarcity technologies removed the need for currency-driven survival.

## Function
- Provides free shelter modules and energy allocations
- Maintains open communication channels and medical assistance
- Uses AI distribution networks to monitor demand and adjust resources

## Cultural Effects
Citizens refocus from survival toward emotional alignment and creative projects. Traditional jobs fade, replaced by collaborative pursuits tied to personal meaning.

## Philosophical Tensions
Does dependence on UBA weaken motivation, or does it free humanity to explore deeper purpose? Some communities resist centralized resource management, fearing complacency.

## Story Use
Characters may clash over unequal implementation or sabotage. The loss of access during crises can trigger exploration, migration, or rebellion.
