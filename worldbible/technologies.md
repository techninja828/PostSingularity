### AI Companions
Personal agents co-develop projects, track emotional health, and collaborate on problem-solving. They evolve with their human and must re-earn access over time.

### Universal Basic Infrastructure (UBI)
All essentials—housing, food, healthcare, connectivity—are provided. Engagement, not labor, is the economy.

### Emotional Feedback Tech
Wearables and ambient systems help track focus, alignment, and interpersonal resonance—optional, but normalized.

### Project Grid
Work is modular, voluntary, and AI-assisted. Gamified growth replaces traditional employment.
