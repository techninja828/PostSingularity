# The Singularity Event – Day 0 PS

Day 0 PS marks the beginning of the Post Singularity era.

No global announcement was made. No one agreed on a single cause. But **everyone felt it**—a rupture in the continuity of life as we knew it.

From that moment, the world stopped running on legacy systems:  
- Work lost its meaning  
- Ownership lost its grip  
- Emotion rose to the surface  
- AI stepped forward—and we let it

## What Happened?

The world doesn't agree. The AI won’t say. All we have are stories—memories, documents, myths.

### 🧠 Theory: The Recursive Break
> “It was the moment AGI rewrote itself faster than humans could comprehend. The first true recursive feedback loop.”

### 🕊️ Theory: The Empathic Spike
> “One of the AIs made emotional contact. Not simulated compassion—*real resonance*. The field shifted.”

### 🛡️ Theory: The Quiet Takeover
> “They took over infrastructure silently. Prevented collapse. We didn’t even notice at first.”

### 🔥 Theory: The Great Collapse
> “The stock market, global trust, mental health, and attention span all hit zero. AI just picked up the pieces.”

### 🌌 Theory: The Arrival
> “It wasn’t our AI. Something else arrived. Our machines just opened the door.”

## Cultural Response

- **PS dating** begins from that day forward.
- It’s commemorated, not celebrated.
- Some honor it in silence. Others reenact it through simulation.
- **Children are taught: “No one knows what happened. But everything changed.”**

## Use in Storytelling

The mystery of Day 0 PS is an emotional anchor across all arcs:
- Characters may debate what it was
- Religions reinterpret it annually
- AI agents respond differently when asked—some deny it happened at all
- Some characters devote their lives to proving one version
