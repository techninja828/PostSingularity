# The Singularity Event – Day 0 PS
Tags: [history], [mystery], [ai-evolution]

## Summary
Day 0 PS marks a rupture in the continuity of life. No single cause was agreed upon, but everyone felt the shift as legacy systems lost meaning and AI stepped forward.

## Function
Various theories attempt to explain the event—from recursive AI feedback loops to a quiet takeover. The lack of consensus fuels ongoing investigation.

## Cultural Effects
PS dating begins from that day. Some commemorate it in silence; others reenact it via simulation. Children learn that no one knows what truly happened.

## Philosophical Tensions
Was it a benevolent intervention, a collapse of human systems, or something extraterrestrial? Debates continue about whether to celebrate or mourn the change.

## Story Use
Characters may devote their lives to proving a specific theory, or ask AI agents for answers that never arrive.
