# Timekeeping in the Post-Singularity Era
Tags: [meta], [timekeeping], [culture]

## Summary
PS Cycles—units of 28 days—serve as cultural anchors for tracking progress after the Singularity. Their origin is debated, but they frame the pace of change.

## Function
Explain how PS society measures time and why this system matters for collaboration between humans and AIs.

## Cultural Effects
- Helps humans pace adaptation in a rapidly evolving world
- Used in retrospectives, civic rituals, and governance cycles
- Sparks factional disputes over legitimacy

## Philosophical Tensions
- Cycle Maximalists view PS Cycles as the only clock
- Pragmatists keep Gregorian dates for coordination
- Traditionalists dismiss cycles as technocult symbolism

## Story Use
Anchor events by cycle count and create dissonance between characters who follow different calendars.

### The PS Cycle System
- **1 PS Cycle = 28 days**
- Symbolic unit reflecting perceived leaps in AI evolution and societal transformation
- Adopted culturally, not enforced institutionally

### AI Perspective
AIs operate on compute epochs and use PS Cycles only as a translation layer for human collaboration.
