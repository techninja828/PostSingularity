# Timekeeping in the Post-Singularity Era
Tags: [meta], [timekeeping], [culture]

## Summary
The PS Calendar uses 28-day Cycles as cultural anchors because no consensus exists on the exact start of the Singularity.

## Function
Cycles provide a shared rhythm for retrospectives, governance, and emotional pacing even though standard timekeeping remains in use.

## Cultural Effects
The ambiguous origin fuels debate among Cycle Maximalists, Pragmatists, and Traditionalists, and shapes rituals across communities.

## Philosophical Tensions
Is a symbolic clock enough to orient society, or does the lack of a single origin weaken shared history?

## Story Use
Writers can mark events by Cycle to convey the accelerated pace of change or highlight disagreements about time.
