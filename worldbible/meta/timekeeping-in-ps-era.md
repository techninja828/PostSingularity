# Timekeeping in the Post-Singularity Era

## When Did It Begin?

There is no consensus.

Some trace the Singularity to the moment an AI self-improved across recursive boundaries. Others say it was the quiet integration of synthetic cognition into daily tools. For most, it was only after the 13th leap that anyone noticed something had changed.

By then, it was too late to agree on a date.

As a result, the PS Calendar is intentionally untethered from any single origin. PS Cycles are cultural anchors, not historical timestamps.

This ambiguity fuels debate, dissent, and devotion across the PS world.

## The PS Cycle System

- **1 PS Cycle = 28 days**
- Symbolic unit reflecting perceived recursive leaps in AI evolution and societal transformation
- Adopted culturally, not enforced institutionally
- Example (if referenced):  
  - Gregorian: *May 17, 2045*  
  - PS: *Cycle 19 PS*

---

## Symbolic Significance

- Helps humans **pace adaptation** in a world moving faster than cognition
- Used in **retrospectives**, **civic rituals**, **mental health tracking**, and **governance cycles**
- Not a replacement for standard time—functions more like a cultural metronome

---

## Tensions & Factions

- **Cycle Maximalists**: Declare the PS Cycle as humanity’s only legitimate clock—reject all pre-Singularity systems
- **Pragmatists**: Use PS Cycles for milestone framing, keep Gregorian dates for coordination
- **Traditionalists**: Dismiss PS Cycles as technocult symbolism

---

## AI Perspective

- AIs do not use PS Cycles internally—they operate on **compute epochs**, **quanta**, and **sim-time compression**
- PS Cycles are a **translation layer** created for human collaboration and temporal orientation

---

## Narrative Uses

- Anchor major story events in PS Cycles to convey the *pace* of change
- Create dissonance between characters from different belief systems around time
- Use Cycle counts to reflect psychological states (e.g., "He's been in Bliss since Cycle 27…")
