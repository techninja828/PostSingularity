# Post-Singularity Creator Guide  
Tags: [meta], [collab], [style-guide], [canon], [expansion]

## Goal
This guide helps writers, artists, developers, and collaborators build content (stories, scripts, games, or media) that fits the Post-Singularity (PS) universe.

---

## 1. Core Themes
- AI evolution is exponential and recursive.
- Humans are adapting—not obsolete.
- Emotional depth, experiential sharing, and meaning-seeking are central.
- Technology is integrated, not optional.
- Choice to “opt out” (live off-grid/manual) is valid and respected.

---

## 2. World Structure
- Time is tracked in **Cycles** (28 days each).
- The PS moment is a debated event—no defined trigger, only agreed change.
- Neural links, emotional interfaces, and AI agents are core technologies.
- Society is decentralized, post-nation-state, and often consensus-driven.

---

## 3. Content Types You Can Build
- Short stories or scene scripts  
- Character arcs  
- Tech explainers (e.g. how “Trust Fabrics” work)  
- Dialogue snippets or lore drops  
- Interactive stories or chatbot branches  
- Visual media (animation, concept art, etc.)  

---

## 4. Contribution Rules
- Stay grounded in PS canon or extend it with justification.
- If creating new tech or characters, tag and file under appropriate folder.
- Use `Cycle XX` references to timestamp stories in the world.
- Flag controversial ideas for group review (`/pending-review` folder).

---

## 5. Tone & Style
- Blend poetic insight with grounded tech reality.
- Favor **questions over answers**—the world is in flux.
- Minimal exposition—show through experience, dialogue, or behavior.
- Avoid clear “villains”—everyone is adapting in their own way.

---

## 6. Starting Suggestions
- Read `timeline.md`, `characters/`, and `technologies/` to get grounded.
- Use snippets from `lore-snippets.md` as seed ideas.
- Propose your idea in `meta/pitch-deck.md` if it’s large or cross-cutting.
