## Summary
A brief handbook for writers, artists, and developers who want to produce content that fits the PS universe.

## Function
Outlines core themes, world structure, content types, contribution rules, tone, and suggestions for getting started.

## Cultural Effects
Shared guidelines ensure new material remains emotionally coherent and philosophically consistent with existing lore.

## Philosophical Tensions
How strictly should collaborative worlds enforce style and canon versus encouraging wild experimentation?

## Story Use
Use this guide when proposing new arcs or media; reference the timelines and character files to stay grounded.
