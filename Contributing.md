# Contributing to Post Singularity

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Post Singularity** universe—a modular, evolving storyworld exploring what it means to be human in the wake of recursive artificial intelligence and neural integration.

This world thrives on emotional coherence, philosophical tension, and deeply human questions.

## ✅ What You Can Contribute

- **Technologies** – From neural implants to decentralized governance systems  
- **Cultural Structures** – Rituals, factions, family dynamics, languages  
- **Characters** – Full bios, partial arcs, or one-scene foils  
- **Lore Threads** – Major events, rumors, perspectives, or timeline branches  
- **Philosophical Questions** – Ethical tradeoffs, political tensions, experiential dilemmas  
- **Scene Snippets** – Visual ideas or dialogue that reveal PS truths through emotion

## 🧠 Contribution Principles

1. **Emotion over exposition**  
   Focus on how people feel and behave, not just how systems work.

2. **Multiple truths, not one canon**  
   Conflicting perspectives are welcome. Let the world be debated, not explained.

3. **Stay grounded in tone**  
   No magic or fantasy elements unless justified through PS science or social delusion.

4. **Respect temporal and emotional coherence**  
   No tech that breaks everything without tension. Characters and societies must respond in ways that feel real.

## Submitting Experimental Ideas
- Place controversial or uncertain concepts in the [`pending-review/`](pending-review/) folder.
- Log the submission in [`submissions-log.md`](submissions-log.md) along with your notes and intended cycle.
- For drawn-out discussions, create a debate branch and issue as described in [docs/debate-branches.md](docs/debate-branches.md) to follow the structured debate process and use the optional voting system if consensus stalls.
- Once discussed and approved, the material can be moved to the appropriate directory or deleted.
