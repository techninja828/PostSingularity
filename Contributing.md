# Contributing to Post Singularity

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the *Post Singularity* universeâ€”a living, modular storyworld that explores what it means to be human after the emergence of AGI.

This world is built on emotional coherence, philosophical tension, and collaborative imagination. Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- New technologies
- Cultural structures
- Characters and perspectives
- Lore threads or timeline branches
- Ethical or philosophical tensions

## ðŸ§  Contribution Principles

1. **Emotion over exposition**  
   Technology, characters, and systems should provoke questions or emotional resonanceâ€”not just detail.

2. **Multiple truths, not one canon**  
   You may add alternate perspectives, disputed events, or conflicting philosophiesâ€”as long as they remain grounded in the PS worldâ€™s tone.

3. **Respect the boundary of coherence**  
   Don't break emotional tone, timeline consistency, or introduce implausible magic/tech unless itâ€™s philosophically addressed.
