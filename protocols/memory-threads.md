# Memory Threads Protocol
Tags: [protocol], [memory], [governance]

## Summary
Memory Threads act as the core narrative scaffolding of the PS world. They track events, relationships, emotional arcs, and cultural shifts across cycles.

## Function
- Ensure transparency for updates to core canon
- Maintain emotional integrity of the world
- Allow for forking and eventual convergence of story branches

## Cultural Effects
Threads become community history. Citizens vote on which branches become canonical and which fade away.

## Philosophical Tensions
- How transparent should personal memories be?
- Can emotional majority override individual truth?
- When does a branch deserve retirement?

## Story Use
Characters reference Memory Threads to guide decisions, revive forgotten lore, or challenge official history.
