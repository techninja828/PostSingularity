# Memory Threads Protocol

Memory Threads are the core narrative scaffolding of the Post Singularity world. They track events, relationships, emotional arcs, and cultural shifts.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency** — All updates to core canon must be visible and traceable.
2. **Emotional Integrity** — New threads must not distort the emotional tone of the world.
3. **Forking Allowed, Convergence Preferred** — Side stories may diverge, but the community elects a primary timeline.

## Components of a Memory Thread

- Origin (character, event, or moment)
- Emotional arc classification (grief, growth, emergence, disconnection, etc.)
- Resonance score (measured by emotional response + vote weight)
- Canonical Status (core / branch / decayed)

## Community Role

Community members or token-holders may vote to:
- Promote a branch thread to core canon
- Retire threads that lose resonance
- Contribute lore to expand unresolved branches
