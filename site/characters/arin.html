<p>Tags: [character], [exploration], [oceanic]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Arin was raised among submerged habitats and travels constantly between
underwater communities and orbital outposts. He bridges marine ecology with
advanced robotics, believing exploration should honor the sea.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Arin maintains fleets of aquatic drones and salvages materials from shipwrecks,
sharing discoveries with both scientists and artisans.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<p>His songs and rituals bring Oceanic customs to the surface, reminding land-based
settlements that the deep sea holds its own wisdom and history.</p>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<p>Should humanity adapt fully to life beneath the waves, or remain visitors to a
realm that resists control?</p>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<p>Arin assists Reya with experimental sensors and partners with Toma to craft
materials that respect fragile ecosystems.</p>
