<h1>Timekeeping in the Post-Singularity Era</h1>
<p>Tags: [meta], [timekeeping], [culture]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The PS Calendar uses 28-day Cycles as cultural anchors because no consensus exists on the exact start of the Singularity.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Cycles provide a shared rhythm for retrospectives, governance, and emotional pacing even though standard timekeeping remains in use.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<p>The ambiguous origin fuels debate among Cycle Maximalists, Pragmatists, and Traditionalists, and shapes rituals across communities.</p>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<p>Is a symbolic clock enough to orient society, or does the lack of a single origin weaken shared history?</p>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<p>Writers can mark events by Cycle to convey the accelerated pace of change or highlight disagreements about time.</p>
