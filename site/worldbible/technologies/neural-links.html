<h1>Neural Links</h1>
<p>Tags: [sensory], [identity], [emotional], [communication], [energy]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Neural links allow for <strong>direct nervous system communication</strong> between the human brain and AI systems. These are not just interfaces—they are <strong>shared realities</strong>.</p>
<p>Neural links enable people to:
- Experience thought-to-thought connection<br />
- Receive streamed emotional states<br />
- Engage in fully immersive creative design<br />
- Trigger states of ecstasy, meditation, or rest<br />
- Temporarily shift identity, memory weight, or sensory input</p>
<p>They are safe, deeply personalized, and bound by <strong>emotional regulation systems</strong> that ensure no one is pushed beyond their psychological threshold—unless they override it by choice.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Embedded during early developmental years or retrofitted in adulthood  </li>
<li>Operate through distributed quantum-node receivers embedded in clothing or skin  </li>
<li>Co-regulated by personal AI agent, which can down-regulate feed intensity based on emotional state</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Relationships often involve shared emotional experiences as bonding rituals  </li>
<li>Creative work (art, engineering, music) frequently begins with neural mood sculpting  </li>
<li>New forms of grief therapy allow people to "feel the echo" of lost loved ones’ emotional archives  </li>
<li>Bliss states are increasingly accessible—but controversial (see: Bliss Divergence)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>If we can choose any emotion at any time, what makes experience real?</li>
<li>Are we still distinct minds, or are we forming a collective nervous system?</li>
<li>Can someone be manipulated emotionally without knowing?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reya uses her link to simulate spacewalks before building orbital structures  </li>
<li>Kai struggles when their link malfunctions during an emotionally complex negotiation  </li>
<li>Some characters belong to a resistance group that believes neural links weaken the human spirit</li>
</ul>
