<h1>Energy Systems</h1>
<p>Tags: [energy], [infrastructure], [sustainability], [governance]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Post Singularity energy relies on distributed harvest and storage, orchestrated by AI to balance planetary needs with personal use. Solar shells, geothermal taps, and kinetic collectors provide nearly limitless power while minimizing ecological disruption.</p>
<p>Energy is treated as a shared commons. Communities negotiate emotional and cultural considerations for large-scale projects, ensuring that progress doesn't overshadow place-based identity.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Solar shells capture radiation in orbit and beam it down via safe converters.</li>
<li>Geothermal and tidal generators integrate with local ecosystems.</li>
<li>Personal micro-grids store energy in bio-compatible cells worn or implanted.</li>
<li>AI governance modules redistribute surplus to areas in crisis or research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy abundance frees citizens from survival labor, fueling exploration and art.</li>
<li>Local rituals mark the turning on of new collectors, blending science with ceremony.</li>
<li>Debates arise over aesthetic impact of visible collectors on sacred landscapes.</li>
<li>Energy gifting becomes a sign of solidarity during emotional hardship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can endless power coexist with ecological humility?</li>
<li>Should individuals have the right to go off-grid entirely?</li>
<li>How does energy equality reshape notions of responsibility and ambition?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mara mediates between a research team and locals over a geothermal tap site.</li>
<li>Reya powers a massive experiment by pooling micro-grid donations from allies.</li>
<li>A blackout caused by sabotage challenges the belief in perpetual abundance.</li>
</ul>
