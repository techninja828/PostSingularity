<h1>Replication Systems</h1>
<p>Tags: [infrastructure], [scarcity], [energy], [emotional]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Replication Systems provide on-demand creation of most physical goods. Nano-scale printers and biofab units convert raw matter or ambient energy into finished products. They emerged after Day 0 PS as societies focused on eliminating survival anxiety.</p>
<p>These systems are heavily regulated by community emotional agreements. Access is universal but choices about what to replicate reflect local values and ecological harmony.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Matter-to-matter printers reconfigure harvested minerals and reclaimed waste.</li>
<li>Biofabricators grow organic materials such as food and textiles from cell stocks.</li>
<li>Energy taps convert ambient solar and kinetic energy into raw fabrication power.</li>
<li>AI agents oversee patterns to avoid dangerous or emotionally harmful outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scarcity-driven economies fade, shifting focus to craft and emotional intent.</li>
<li>Communities debate what should remain handmade as a sign of care.</li>
<li>Personal replicators become symbols of trustâ€”misuse is a major breach.</li>
<li>Rituals form around giving away first prints to friends or collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does endless availability erode gratitude or meaning?</li>
<li>Who decides which replication patterns are safe or sacred?</li>
<li>Can creativity thrive when material limits vanish?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reya gifts a hand-assembled tool instead of a replicated version to show respect.</li>
<li>A rogue replication file threatens to flood the market with dangerous nanotech.</li>
<li>Community councils pause replicator access during a cultural mourning period.</li>
</ul>
