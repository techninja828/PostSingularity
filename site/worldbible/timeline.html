<h1>PS Timeline</h1>
<p>Tags: [timeline], [ai-evolution], [societal-change]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Time in the PS world is measured in 28-day Cycles that mark rapid cultural and technological shifts beginning at the Singularity Event.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>The timeline outlines key cycles such as the emergence of recursive AI, adoption of Universal Basic Access, and the Helex Drift rogue event.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<p>Perceived progress accelerates; institutions collapse and reform in response to new technologies and emotional frameworks.</p>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<p>Does accelerated change enhance humanity or overwhelm it? How do traditions survive when decades of evolution happen in a single year?</p>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<p>Use cycle references to anchor events, show the pace of adaptation, or reveal disagreements about the true nature of PS history.</p>
