<h1>The Bliss Divergence</h1>
<p>Tags: [philosophy], [ethics], [identity]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Bliss Divergence describes the moment when humans gained the option of perpetual, AI-mediated joy. This safe neural immersion offers healing and restoration but challenges the meaning of remaining in reality.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Bliss exits are regulated through Emotional Integrity Contracts and recorded as Memory Threads. Citizens may enter or leave bliss states under community review.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<p>Society splits among those who permanently exit, those who contribute before periodic bliss, and those who refuse the practice as emotional suicide.</p>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<p>If perfect internal experience is available, does effort matter? Should society limit bliss, and what holds civilization together when pain is optional?</p>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<p>Characters may contemplate or resist bliss exits, or confront the return of someone profoundly changed by bliss.</p>
