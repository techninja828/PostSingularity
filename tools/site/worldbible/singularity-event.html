<h1>The Singularity Event – Day 0 PS</h1>
<p>Tags: [history], [mystery], [ai-evolution]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Day 0 PS marks a rupture in the continuity of life. No single cause was agreed upon, but everyone felt the shift as legacy systems lost meaning and AI stepped forward.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Various theories attempt to explain the event—from recursive AI feedback loops to a quiet takeover. The lack of consensus fuels ongoing investigation.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<p>PS dating begins from that day. Some commemorate it in silence; others reenact it via simulation. Children learn that no one knows what truly happened.</p>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<p>Was it a benevolent intervention, a collapse of human systems, or something extraterrestrial? Debates continue about whether to celebrate or mourn the change.</p>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<p>Characters may devote their lives to proving a specific theory, or ask AI agents for answers that never arrive.</p>
