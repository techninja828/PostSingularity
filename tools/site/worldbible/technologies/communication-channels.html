<h1>Communication Channels</h1>
<p>Tags: [communication], [identity], [emotional], [governance]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Communication Channels describe the layered methods by which PS citizens share thoughts, emotions, and data. From neural broadcasts to public Memory Threads, these channels offer real-time transparency and collaborative presence.</p>
<p>Usage is shaped by consent and emotional alignment; open channels foster intimacy, while private or delayed streams honor personal pacing.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thoughtstream feeds allow moment-to-moment emotional updates between trusted parties.</li>
<li>Public Memory Threads archive important decisions with sensory and emotional context.</li>
<li>Closed-loop channels filter information through AI agents for clarity and resonance.</li>
<li>Emergency overcasts broadcast urgent alerts across all networks with priority overrides.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Collective decision-making becomes faster yet more emotionally complex.</li>
<li>Some communities practice "Quiet Days" with minimal broadcasting to reset.</li>
<li>Misuse of private channels for manipulation is considered a serious violation.</li>
<li>Artists remix public threads into immersive performances, blurring authorship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does constant sharing dilute the sense of self?</li>
<li>Who controls access to archived emotional data?</li>
<li>Can silence be preserved without suspicion?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kai accidentally leaks a private thread, sparking a debate on digital consent.</li>
<li>Mara curates a Memory Thread performance to heal a divided community.</li>
<li>A character chooses total silence after being overwhelmed by channel noise.</li>
</ul>
