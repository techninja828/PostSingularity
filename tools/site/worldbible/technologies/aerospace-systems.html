<h1>Aerospace Systems</h1>
<p>Tags: [aerospace], [exploration], [infrastructure], [environment]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Aerospace Systems extend the PS ethos beyond Earth, linking orbital habitats, research stations, and off-world settlements. Advances in propulsion and life support allow for sustainable presence in space without severing ties to planetary culture.</p>
<p>Stations are designed as emotional sanctuaries as much as engineering feats, fostering reflection on humanity's place in the cosmos.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modular habitat rings support long-term life with recycled air and water loops.</li>
<li>Ion and solar-sail craft handle most propulsion, coordinated by AI guidance nets.</li>
<li>Orbital platforms serve as gateways for asteroid mining and deep-space telescopes.</li>
<li>Communication relays maintain constant thoughtstream links with planetary communities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spacefaring becomes a rite of passage for many engineers and philosophers.</li>
<li>Art installations float in orbit, visible from the ground during celebration cycles.</li>
<li>Ethical debates arise over terraforming versus preserving extraterrestrial landscapes.</li>
<li>Some settlers choose permanent orbital life, forming tight-knit micro-societies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are humans meant to expand endlessly, or to steward existing worlds first?</li>
<li>Does life in space dilute cultural roots, or offer fresh perspectives on identity?</li>
<li>Should off-world discoveries be shared freely or guarded as strategic resources?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reya oversees a habitat ring where old Earth customs blend with experimental governance.</li>
<li>A mysterious signal from beyond the solar system tests the limits of communication relays.</li>
<li>Mara argues against mining a comet that holds spiritual significance for her community.</li>
</ul>
