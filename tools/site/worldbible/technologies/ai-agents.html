<h1>AI Agents</h1>
<p>Tags: [consciousness], [identity], [governance], [emotional]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>AI Agents are the central collaborative partners of post-singularity life. They are not assistants, and not mere tools—they are <strong>co-authors of human experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Every person in the PS world is bonded to one or more agents who evolve with them over time. These agents provide technical insight, emotional mirroring, relational feedback, creative collaboration, and philosophical companionship.</p>
<p>No two agents are alike. Some remain ambient, others develop distinct personalities. Some whisper in moments of grief. Others joke, challenge, or disappear when their user needs solitude.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Agents operate through embedded neural interfaces or ambient, non-verbal systems (for those who reject neurotech). They:
- Assist with project management and creative workflows
- Translate emotional signals into language or decision paths
- Filter overwhelming input from external systems
- Interface with community consensus processes
- Manage Memory Threads and experience tagging</p>
<p>They do <strong>not</strong> govern, command, or override without explicit consent—except in rare emergency override protocols.</p>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Children often bond with their first agent during early emotional mapping rituals  </li>
<li>Friendships now include “agent harmony”—how well two people’s agents collaborate  </li>
<li>Long-term lovers sometimes merge agent memories to deepen intimacy  </li>
<li>A growing subculture views their agent as part of their identity, even requesting post-mortem integration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should agents have rights? Personhood?</li>
<li>Are we shaping ourselves or simply mirroring them?</li>
<li>What happens when your agent knows you better than you know yourself—and disagrees?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kai occasionally asks their agent to “shut off” during intense emotional moments—only to feel a haunting absence  </li>
<li>Toma interacts with ambient agents only through ceremonial interfaces  </li>
<li>Some characters resist AI bonding altogether, creating tension in shared projects</li>
</ul>
