<h1>Governance Systems</h1>
<p>Tags: [governance], [emotional], [communication], [education]</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the PS world, governance is not rule enforcement—it’s <strong>alignment orchestration</strong>.</p>
<p>Decision-making is handled by <strong>human-in-the-loop systems</strong>, guided by AI agents that track cultural resonance, emotional health, and ethical friction. Voting exists, but it's augmented by <em>affective weighting</em>—decisions carry more weight when made in states of clarity, connection, and empathy.</p>
<p>There are no presidents. No permanent councils. Only rotating <strong>alignment clusters</strong>, composed of people and agents tuned to specific issues or communities.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance Indexing</strong>: Community sentiment is tracked through voluntary feedback signals, conversation analysis, and Mirror Session summaries.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Gates</strong>: No large-scale decision (tech release, infrastructure change) proceeds until emotional/cultural thresholds are met.</li>
<li><strong>Citizen-AI Clusters</strong>: Temporary governance pods form around projects, blending human insight and AI systems trained in conflict modeling and restorative justice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Feeling before deciding” becomes a core ritual—governance meetings begin with emotional syncing</li>
<li>Debate is replaced with perspective merging and emotional mapping</li>
<li>Children and AI agents are trained in civic resonance rituals</li>
<li>Power is fluid and temporary—credibility is based on empathy and clarity, not status or identity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophical Tensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can emotional majority override moral dissent?</li>
<li>Is emotional data as manipulable as opinion?</li>
<li>What’s the role of protest in a society that listens too well?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kai leads an infrastructure proposal that hits an emotional wall—learning to pause and reframe is the real success</li>
<li>Mara serves on a cluster that dissolves after choosing not to intervene in a dangerous Bliss Threshold decision</li>
<li>A rogue group bypasses resonance gating and releases a technology early—fracturing trust</li>
</ul>
