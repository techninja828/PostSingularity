# Reya â€“ The Engineer
Tags: [character], [innovation], [exploration]

## Summary
Reya spent her youth near the bustling Holo Bazaar, scavenging discarded gadgets
and dreaming of new ways to connect distant settlements. Early mentors taught her
to read weathered schematics and respect the people who built them.

After years in the Submerged Archives, she joined orbital engineers to craft
habitats capable of supporting fragile ecosystems. Her designs range from modular
stations to climate drones that protect coastal villages.

What sets Reya apart is her insistence on blending emotional data with structural
analysis. She believes technology must respond to human feelings as much as to
physical stress tests.

Though celebrated as a visionary, she remains cautious about runaway automation.
Reya mentors younger builders, always reminding them that exploration must serve
more than economic ambition.

## Function
Reya integrates emotional data into engineering choices, balancing expansion with sacred stewardship of the cosmos.

## Cultural Effects
Her projects influence off-world settlements and push society toward empathic exploration beyond Earth.

## Philosophical Tensions
She clashes with Toma over automation and often questions whether humanity is ready to venture beyond Earth.

## Story Use
Reya must decide if AI or human pilots should guide her first off-world sanctuary.

## Personal History
Growing up near the bustling Holo Bazaar, Reya scavenged old tech before studying forgotten schematics in the Submerged Archives. Her family roots lie in the deserts of North Africa, where resourceful communities shaped her respect for resilience. She later joined orbital engineers to blend ancient insight with cutting-edge design.

## Appearance
Reya is tall with warm brown skin and dark eyes. Her tightly coiled black hair is often braided close to her head, and she wears functional jumpsuits with lightweight exoskeleton harnesses.

## Relationship to AI
She engineers with AI partners yet keeps manual overrides to ensure every design honors human ethics over efficiency.

## Ties to Key Locations
Reya maintains a laboratory module in the Orbital Sanctuary where she prototypes habitats for remote settlements.
