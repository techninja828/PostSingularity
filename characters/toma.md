# Toma â€“ The Analogist
Tags: [character], [craft], [tradition]

## Summary
Toma grew up among artisan guilds clustered around Analog Haven, spending most of
his youth in woodshops and on rugged farms. Elders taught him that every tool
carries a spirit and every craft demands patience.

As an adult he constructed a semi-off-grid enclave where modular dwellings are
built entirely by hand. Visitors trade skills with him, learning to shape leather
and grow crops without relying on mass automation.

Toma now mentors travelers who seek a slower path. He demonstrates how deliberate
labor can nurture both community and resilience, even in a world racing toward
synthetic convenience.

While he accepts AI for basic resource tracking, Toma refuses to let algorithms
dictate creative choices. His workshops prove that tradition and innovation can
coexist only when humans remain at the center.

## Function
He preserves manual techniques such as leatherworking and biodynamic farming, teaching others to value struggle and craftsmanship.

## Cultural Effects
Toma's enclave highlights the coexistence of high-tech society with slow, traditional practices, reminding others that meaning can outlast automation.

## Philosophical Tensions
He questions whether technology can support life without hollowing it out, resisting the push to replicate his work through neural scanning.

## Story Use
Toma often builds for those who once insulted him, demonstrating service and humility.

## Personal History
Descended from craft guilds around Analog Haven, Toma learned woodworking and biodynamic farming from elders who survived the Singularity. His ancestry combines Eastern European and Levantine lineages, shaping a stoic yet hospitable demeanor. Years of manual labor left him with calloused hands and a reputation for patient mentorship.

## Appearance
Toma stands nearly 1.8 meters tall with a sturdy frame, tan skin, and a short beard. Deep-set hazel eyes and weathered hands reveal decades of craftsmanship. He dresses in hand-stitched garments dyed with natural pigments.

## Relationship to AI
He employs low-level AI only for resource tracking, refusing automated shortcuts that could erode the artistry of his work.

## Ties to Key Locations
Toma rarely leaves Analog Haven except to trade at the Holo Bazaar and consult the Submerged Archives for forgotten techniques.
