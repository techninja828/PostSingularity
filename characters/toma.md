# Toma – The Analogist

**Role:** Artisan and builder of modular, entirely handmade living systems. Lives in a semi-off-grid enclave where AI is tolerated but not obeyed.

**Beliefs:**  
- Struggle is sacred. Craft reveals character.  
- AI can support life, but not **live it**.  
- Mass-produced goods—even perfect ones—lack meaning.

**Practices:**  
- Leatherworking, wood joinery, biodynamic farming  
- Participates in mirror sessions only when consent is deeply earned  
- Occasionally teaches young PS citizens how to “make something that’ll outlive you”

**Narrative Arc Ideas:**  
- Builds a cabin for someone who once insulted him—redefines service  
- Faces pressure to “replicate” his work using neural-scanned modeling  
- Learns that presence can also be scaled—but must decide if he trusts it
