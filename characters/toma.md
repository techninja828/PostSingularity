## Cultural Effects
Embodies a slower, tactile approach to life that resists mass automation.

- Considers mass-produced goods devoid of meaning
- Faces pressure to replicate work through neural scans

## Story Use

- Debates whether to mirror his craft via advanced modeling
- Learns that presence can scale only if trust is earned
