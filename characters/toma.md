Tags: [character], [craft], [tradition]

## Summary
Toma is an artisan who builds modular living systems entirely by hand, living in a semi-off-grid enclave where AI is tolerated but rarely obeyed.

## Function
He preserves manual techniques such as leatherworking and biodynamic farming, teaching others to value struggle and craftsmanship.

## Cultural Effects
Toma's enclave highlights the coexistence of high-tech society with slow, traditional practices, reminding others that meaning can outlast automation.

## Philosophical Tensions
He questions whether technology can support life without hollowing it out, resisting the push to replicate his work through neural scanning.

## Story Use
Toma often builds for those who once insulted him, demonstrating service and humility.

## Personal History
Descended from craft guilds around Analog Haven, Toma learned woodworking and biodynamic farming from elders who survived the Singularity.

## Relationship to AI
He employs low-level AI only for resource tracking, refusing automated shortcuts that could erode the artistry of his work.

## Ties to Key Locations
Toma rarely leaves Analog Haven except to trade at the Holo Bazaar and consult the Submerged Archives for forgotten techniques.
