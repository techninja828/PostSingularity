# Arin â€“ The Oceanic Nomad
Tags: [character], [exploration], [oceanic]

## Summary
Arin was raised among submerged habitats and travels constantly between
underwater communities and orbital outposts. He bridges marine ecology with
advanced robotics, believing exploration should honor the sea.

## Function
Arin maintains fleets of aquatic drones and salvages materials from shipwrecks,
sharing discoveries with both scientists and artisans.

## Cultural Effects
His songs and rituals bring Oceanic customs to the surface, reminding land-based
settlements that the deep sea holds its own wisdom and history.

## Philosophical Tensions
Should humanity adapt fully to life beneath the waves, or remain visitors to a
realm that resists control?

## Story Use
Arin assists Reya with experimental sensors and partners with Toma to craft
materials that respect fragile ecosystems.
